_Realization of the [SCATS](https://github.com/Paveloom/C3) library in Julia._

A package for completing spectral correlation analysis of time series.

!!! note

    This package was developed primarily for learning purposes and is not advised to be
    used in production.

## Features
- generation of the uniform time series with custom number of harmonics;
- eliminating a linear trend from time series;
- periodogram and correlogram computations using FFT;
- weighted correlogram computation using Tukey weighting function;
- smoothed periodogram computation using FFT.
